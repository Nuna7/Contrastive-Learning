    USER: 
    Each number tags represent a semantic region defined by the masks. 
    The black block with number in the middle in first color are the tags for the regions.
    Assign a label to each number tag based on the region.
    If the region is not relevant, just ignore it.

    Follow this **exact** format: {number:label}. 

    Example: An image with 3 regions, where the first region is a cat with number tag 1, 
    the second region is a dog with number tag 2, and the third region is a tree with number tag 3.
    Output: {1:cat, 2:dog, 3:tree}
